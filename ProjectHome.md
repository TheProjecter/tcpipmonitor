Nice to have:
  * Allow viewing formatting to be selected via a drop down menu
  * Automatically set the viewing format depending on the received content type
  * Allow saving of the request and response content to a file with options on what should be saved
  * Implement auto alerts that make the user aware that an error has occurred ( maybe a customisable wordlist that can be checked for in the content)
  * Tab names should be in bold If a new connection has been captured

Needs doing at some point:
  * Include .jars in SVN that are needed to run app
  * General code cleanup

Current Work:
  * Create configuration allowing the application to access addresses through a proxy
  * Saving these proxy settings to and XML file
